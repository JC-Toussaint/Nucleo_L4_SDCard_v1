@par Description

This directory contains the STM32 Nucleo Power GUI tool and the binaries that
must be used on the Nucleo boards when running this tool.
 
The STM32 Nucleo Power GUI tool connects to the STM32 Nucleo hardware boards 
supported by the firmware package. It allows selecting the various low-power modes 
and benchmarking codes thanks to the available binary files. Users can therefore 
quickly assess STM32L4 low-power performance.

 + Using "STM32 Nucleo Power GUI tool"    
    - Connect the STM32 Nucleo board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Micro-B' 
      (Nucleo-32 or Nucleo-144) or 'USB type A to Mini-B' (Nucleo-64) cable 
      through USB connector CN1 to power the board.
    - Select the wanted binary and reprogram the STM32 Nucleo firmware 
      (ex. STM32 ST-LINK Utility, available for download from www.st.com).
      Once done, to ensure all IOs are at their reset levels, unplug then plug
      the board again. 
    - Connect an amperemeter to the IDD jumper (JP5 for Nucleo-144, JP6 for 
      Nucleo-64, JP1 for Nucleo-32).      
    - Unzip "Nucleo GUI.zip" on your laptop or desktop and launch Qtserial.exe.
    - Obey the instructions appearing on the screen in connecting to the COM port
      associated with the Nucleo board.
    - Pick one low power mode proposed among those by the GUI tool and press
      "Confirm".
    - Measure the MCU power consumption on the amperemeter.
    - Reset the board before picking up another low power mode. Use the Reset 
      button on Nucleo-64 or Nucleo-144, connect a wire between GND and NRST pins
      on Nucleo-32.
